# General

- Print code considering formatting rules defined in by nearest Prettier config
  and Biome config to save up on further code movement

# Naming Conventions

1. Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
2. Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
3. Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
4. Favor named exports for components
5. While rendering lists in JSX, keep JSX clean:
   1. Declare a list identifier in component body
   2. Use variableNameListJSX pattern, for example â€” usersListJSX
   3. This is a focus on keeping the code minimalistic, consize and readable

# Imports

- Prefer named imports/exports over default imports/exports

# TypeScript

- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Prefer interfaces over types for Component Props
- Avoid enums
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation
